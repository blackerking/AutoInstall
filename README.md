# AutoInstall

## "Small" tool for installing software/updates
and much more.
Can install:     MSI ; EXE
Can apply:       REG; PS1

The main idea was to automate the most
installation and configuration procedure.
Neat tool for small IT-offices and sale-
points.

Detects architectur and version, makes
installation and preperation for new PCs a
lot faster.

First entry is configurable for most used
settings. Second for choosing software.

Registryhacks are applied all.
